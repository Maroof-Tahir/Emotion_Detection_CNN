🚀 Project Update: Emotion Detection Using CNNs 🚀

I'm thrilled to share my recent project where I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and classify emotions from grayscale images. This project involved various advanced technologies and techniques, and I'm excited to highlight some key aspects:

📊 Objective:
To build an accurate emotion detection system that can classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more from images.

🗂 Dataset:
I used a labeled dataset of facial images, which were preprocessed and augmented using Keras' ImageDataGenerator to enhance the model's robustness.

🛠 Technologies:

    OpenCV (cv2) for image processing
    Keras with a TensorFlow backend for building and training the CNN
    ImageDataGenerator for data preprocessing and augmentation

🔍 Model Architecture:
The model consists of several Conv2D layers followed by MaxPooling2D and Dropout layers to prevent overfitting. After flattening the data, Dense layers were used with a final softmax activation for classification.

⚙️ Training:

    Optimizer: Adam
    Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
    Trained for 50 epochs with batch size of 64

📈 Results:
Achieved an impressive accuracy on the validation set, demonstrating the model's effectiveness.

💡 Challenges:
One of the key challenges was managing overfitting, which I addressed using Dropout layers and data augmentation techniques.

🔮 Future Work:
I'm looking forward to improving the model by experimenting with different architectures and expanding the dataset. Potential applications include enhancing user experience in HCI systems and developing more intuitive AI assistants.
